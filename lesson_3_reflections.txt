1.when would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when there are more than 1 programmer working on a repository
2.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Manually pulling will not affect my existing work
3.Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is cloing an existing repository on Git hub, clone is to create a copy of repository from git hub on to my local 
system, branch is a copy of local repository created for working on any experimental work.
4.What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It avoids sync conflicts between remote and local repository
